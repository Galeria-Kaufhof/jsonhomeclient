# json-home-client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Galeria-Kaufhof/jsonhomeclient.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Galeria-Kaufhof/jsonhomeclient)

No-magic Scala client to consume [JSON home documents](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-03) like this:

```json
{
  "resources": {
    "http://spec.example.org/rels/artists": {
      "href": "/artists"
    },
    "http://spec.example.org/rels/artist": {
	  "href-template": "/artists/{artist-id}",
      "href-vars": {
        "artist-id": "http://spec.example.org/params/artist"
      }
	}
  }
}
```

The json-home-client regularly loads json home documents from json home document providers, and caches them in memory.
When your application retrieves some information from this json-home-client, the cached json home documents are used so that
there'll be no network roundtrip.

This library was built for Play! Framework 2.5.x projects and uses [Play's WS client](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaWS)
and [Play's JSON library](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJson).

If you're looking for the Play 2.3.x version check out the [play-2.3.x branch](https://github.com/Galeria-Kaufhof/jsonhomeclient/tree/play-2.3.x).

## Installation

You must add the json-home-client to the dependencies of the build file, e.g. add to `build.sbt`:

    libraryDependencies += "de.kaufhof" %% "json-home-client" % "2.1.0"

It is published to maven central for 2.11.

## Usage

At first you setup the `JsonHomeService` for various hosts that provide json home documents.
The first host serves a json home like the one shown above.

```scala
import de.kaufhof.jsonhomeclient._

// Specify which service/host provides which link relations
// By default, json home docs are assumed to be served from `/.well-known/home`.
val host1 = JsonHomeHost("http://some.host", Seq(
  // A link relation without params
  DirectLinkRelationType("http://spec.example.org/rels/artists"),
  // A link relation with template params
  TemplateLinkRelationType("http://spec.example.org/rels/artist")
))

// Create the client, it loads the json home doc from the host (using Play's WSClient for http)
// In a non-Play app, the WSClient can be created via `new NingWSClient(new AsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder().build())`,
// in this setup you should also `close()` the WSClient when the app is stopped.
val client1 = new JsonHomeClient(host1, WS.client)

// Create the cache, it will regularly (using the Akka scheduler) load json home doc
// using the client. The initialTimeToWait is used for requests when the schedule did not yet
// kick in (might happen e.g. in tests) so that the json home doc was not yet requested/loaded.
// In this case the json home doc is directly loaded from the client and the cache will wait for
// the result using the given `initialTimeToWait`.
val cache1 = new JsonHomeCache(client1, Akka.system, updateInterval = 5 minutes, initialTimeToWait = 10 seconds)

// The json home service, the interface for applications, set up with several json home caches
val jsonHomeService = JsonHomeService(Seq(cache1, cache2, ...))
```

Once the json home service is set up, you can use it to retrieve links for link-relations.

```scala
// Example 1: Get a link relation that does not expect template params
jsonHomeService.getUrl(
  host1,
  DirectLinkRelationType("http://spec.example.org/rels/artists")
) == Some("/artists")

// Example 2: Some link relation that expects template params
jsonHomeService.getUrl(
  host1,
  TemplateLinkRelationType("http://spec.example.org/rels/artist"),
  Map("artist-id" -> "acdc")
) == Some("/artists/acdc")
```
